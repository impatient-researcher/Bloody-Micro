\section{Question}\label{sec:question}

Refer to the textbook for the actual wordings of the question. The main idea is to show that if:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item the set of outcome is finite
  \item the individual's preference over the set of outcomes is \textit{rational}\footnote{That is preference is complete and transitive}
  \item the independence axiom is satisfied
\end{enumerate}

\noindent Then you can always find the best and the worst lottery.

\section{Answer}\label{sec:answer}

To prove this, we construct the best and the worst lottery directly.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Denote the set of outcomes by $C$ and the rational relation by $\succcurlyeq$.

    \item As the set $C$ is finite, $\succcurlyeq$ is complete and transitive, there must exist at least one outome that is deemed to the best and and at least one deemed to be the worst.\footnote{$C$ being finite means there are just that many pairwise comparisons to be done, and rational preference implies that the individual can compare any pair of outcomes (completeness) and form a uncontradictory ordering of outcomes (transitivity).}

    \item WLOG, let the number of outcomes be $N$ such that:
    $$c_1 \succ c_2 \succ c_3 \succ \dots \succ c_N$$

    \item Let $L$ be a generic lottery which takes the form:
    $$L = \left( p_1 \circ c_1, p_2 \circ c_2, p_3 \circ c_3, \dots, p_N \circ c_N \right)$$

    \item We can make the lottery $L$ more attractive\footnote{This is because except $c_2$ all other items are the same. And by IA, $L' \succ L \iff c_1 \succ c_2$} by replacing $c_2$ by $c_1$:
    $$L' = \left( p_1 \circ c_1, p_2 \circ \highlight{c_1}, p_3 \circ c_3, \dots, p_N \circ c_N \right)$$

    \item Following this logic, we can create an even better lottery by successively replacing $c_3, \dots, c_N$ by $c_1$. Clearly, there's no room for improvement when we have replaced all outcomes in $L$ with $c_1$ that is:
    $$\overline{L} = \left( p_1 \circ c_1, p_2 \circ \highlight{c_1}, p_3 \circ \highlight{c_1}, \dots, p_N \circ \highlight{c_1} \right)$$

    Implying that $\overline{L}$ constructed this way is indeed the best lottery.

    \item Similarly one can construct the worst lottery $\underbar{L}$ by replacing all outcomes by $c_N$. $\square$
